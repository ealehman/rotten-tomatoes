rotten-tomatoes
===============
Analyzes movie reviews using data from the Rotten Tomatoes API. The four main 
objectives of the implementation are:
	1) work with a web API
	2) taking a Bayesian approach in order to make and interpret 
	   predictions 
	3) Use the Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether a movie review is
	   positive or negative
	4) Optimizing models using cross validation

The code was written for a problem set for Harvard University course CS109.
